 gwaleod_intro_event.0001.desc: "Some fools call Wales a land of barren valleys and rugged hills, unfit for civilization. If only they could see Cantre'r Gwaleod!\n\nI rule the Lowland Hundred with a light hand, for the rich plains and teeming forests of my domain deliver up riches to even the most feckless churls — and my own magic basket, my #italic mwys#!, ensures no courtiers mine lack the least thing.\n\nFrom my fastness in the hills I see green fields, stretching from the storm-wracked dike of Sarn Badrig to the borders with Gwynedd and Ceredigion. Though Sarn Badrig protects my people from the sea, the waters seem to rise ever higher. Perhaps it is time to reinforce the dike and set a closer watch on the sluices, lest misfortune or carelessness lead to catastrophe across the lowlands."
 gwaleod_intro_event.0001.a: "The future is bright for my realm."
